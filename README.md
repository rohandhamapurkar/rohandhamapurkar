Greetings! I'm Rohan, a passionate developer with a mission to simplify complex business processes. As the founder of OrderStack, I'm dedicated to developing and maintaining innovative automation systems that enable companies to streamline their operations.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in Golang, and I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects to collaborate on. If you're interested in discussing system architecture or have any NodeJS server framework suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Let's connect and exchange ideas on all things related to Go, NodeJS, MongoDB, System Architecture, and Database Design. You can reach me at rohan@orderstack.xyz, and my preferred pronouns are he/him.

In my free time, I love watching movies and TV shows. If you're curious about what I'm watching, check out my profile on trakt.tv.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities with you!
